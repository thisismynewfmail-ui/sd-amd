# Running on AMD Radeon

This fork runs on AMD GPUs as well as NVIDIA ones. The compute backend is
detected automatically at launch; nothing has to be configured by hand for the
common cases.

---

## Quick start (Windows)

Reference configuration this was set up for:

| | |
|---|---|
| CPU | AMD Ryzen 5 3600 (6C/12T) |
| RAM | 64 GB DDR4 |
| GPU | AMD Radeon RX 6800 (16 GB, `gfx1030`, RDNA 2) |
| OS | Windows 10 x64 |

1. Install **64-bit Python 3.13** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   Tick **"Add python.exe to PATH"** during setup.
   *(3.12 also works. 3.11 and older do not — the AMD wheels are `cp312`/`cp313` only.)*
2. Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
3. Update the **AMD Adrenalin** driver to a current release.
4. Double-click **`webui-user-amd.bat`**.

The first launch downloads a ROCm build of PyTorch (several GB) and creates the
`venv` folder. Later launches skip straight to the UI.

There is nothing else to install — the ROCm runtime ships inside the Python
wheels. You do **not** need the HIP SDK unless you are using the ZLUDA fallback.

---

## Without the `.bat` launcher (conda / venv)

`webui-user-amd.bat` only sets `COMMANDLINE_ARGS` and calls `webui.bat`, which
manages a `venv` for you. If you would rather bring your own environment,
activate it and run `launch.py` directly:

```bash
conda create -n imgen python=3.13
conda activate imgen
python launch.py --gpu-backend rocm --pin-shared-memory
```

**Do not `pip install -r requirements.txt` first.** `requirements.txt` lists
`torch` unpinned, so pip resolves it from PyPI — and the PyPI Windows wheels are
**CPU-only**. (`facexlib` pulls in a CPU `torchvision` the same way.) The result
looks like a complete install but has no GPU support:

```
RuntimeError: PyTorch (ROCm) cannot see your Radeon GPU.
```

`launch.py` installs the correct PyTorch build itself, before the requirements,
and it inspects the *build* rather than just checking that torch is importable.
So if you already have CPU wheels in your environment, just run `launch.py` —
it detects the mismatch and replaces them:

```
Replacing PyTorch: torch is a 'cpu' build, but the 'rocm' backend needs 'rocm*'
```

The same check runs after the requirements step, so an extension that reinstalls
PyTorch behind your back gets reported instead of silently disabling your GPU.

## The backends

`--gpu-backend` selects one explicitly; the default (`auto`) picks the first
that applies.

| Backend | Hardware | PyTorch build | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cuda` | NVIDIA | `cu130` | unchanged from upstream |
| `rocm` | AMD | `+rocm` | **recommended for Radeon**; native, no extra install |
| `zluda` | AMD, Windows | `cu118` | fallback; needs the AMD HIP SDK |
| `directml` | any DX12 GPU | `torch-directml` | last resort, see caveats below |
| `cpu` | — | `+cpu` | very slow; for testing only |

### `rocm` — native ROCm (recommended)

On Windows this uses AMD's ["TheRock"](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock) wheels,
which are published per GPU family. Your card's family is detected from the HIP
runtime that ships with the Adrenalin driver:

| Family | Cards |
|---|---|
| `gfx103X-dgpu` | RX 6800 / 6800 XT / 6900 XT / 6950 XT / 6700 / 6600 / 6500 |
| `gfx110X-all` | RX 7900 / 7800 / 7700 / 7600 |
| `gfx120X-all` | RX 9070 / 9060 |
| `gfx1151` | Ryzen AI Max (Strix Halo) |

On Linux the first-party wheels from `download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm7.1` are used
instead.

If detection gets it wrong, force it:

```bat
set SD_AMD_ARCH=gfx1030
```

or point at a different wheel index entirely:

```bat
set ROCM_INDEX_URL=https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2-staging/gfx103X-dgpu/
```

### `zluda` — CUDA translation

For Radeon cards AMD does not publish ROCm wheels for. ZLUDA implements the
CUDA driver API on top of HIP, so the normal `cu118` PyTorch works.

1. Install the [AMD HIP SDK](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/rocm-hub/hip-sdk.html)
   — **version 6.2 or 6.4**. ZLUDA does not support HIP SDK 7.x.
2. Launch with `--gpu-backend zluda`.

ZLUDA itself is downloaded automatically into `.zluda` on first use.

Add `--zluda-nightly` to get the nightly build, which enables hipBLASLt and
MIOpen (faster, but less stable). `--reinstall-zluda` wipes and re-downloads it.

The first generation after each launch is slow — ZLUDA compiles kernels on the
fly and caches them.

### `directml`

`torch-directml` pins PyTorch to 2.4.1 and Python ≤ 3.12, which is at the very
bottom of what this codebase supports. It is much slower than ROCm, does not
support `bf16` or `fp8` weights, and several features are disabled under it.
Use it only if neither `rocm` nor `zluda` works on your machine.

## Tuning for a 16 GB card with plenty of RAM

`webui-user-amd.bat` ships with:

```bat
set COMMANDLINE_ARGS=--gpu-backend rocm --pin-shared-memory
```

`--pin-shared-memory` page-locks system RAM (up to 45% of it on Windows) so that
weights offloaded out of VRAM stream back quickly. With 64 GB installed this is
close to free, and it is what makes large models usable on 16 GB of VRAM.

Other options worth knowing:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--cuda-stream 2` | overlaps weight transfers with compute |
| `--reserve-vram 1.0` | leaves 1 GB of VRAM for the desktop |
| `--lowvram` / `--novram` | more aggressive offloading |
| `--use-pytorch-cross-attention` | SDPA instead of the sliced fallback |
| `--bf16-unet` | keep bf16 weights (see below) |
| `--fp16-unet` | force fp16 weights |
| `--disable-gpu-warning` | silence low-VRAM warnings |

### Precision on RDNA 2

RDNA 2 has no bf16 matrix hardware, so weights are stored and computed in
**fp16** by default even for models that ship as bf16 (Flux, Krea 2, Qwen-Image,
Wan). This is the right trade — bf16 on `gfx1030` is emulated and several times
slower.

If a specific model produces black or corrupted images in fp16, pass
`--bf16-unet` for it. It will be slow but numerically faithful.

### Attention

`gfx1030` and older have no FlashAttention kernels (AOTriton, which provides
them on ROCm, starts at `gfx90a`/`gfx1100`). The default is the sliced
`attention_basic` implementation, which adapts its slice size to free VRAM and
therefore degrades gracefully at high resolutions.

`--use-pytorch-cross-attention` switches to PyTorch SDPA, pinned to the math
backend. It is faster at ordinary resolutions but allocates an O(N²) attention
matrix, so it can run out of memory during hires-fix on large images.

### Large models (Krea 2, Flux, Qwen-Image, Wan)

These do not fit in 16 GB at full precision, and are handled by keeping the
weights in a compact format and casting them per-layer as they are used:

* **GGUF** checkpoints — fully supported, and the best option on 16 GB.
* **fp8 (`e4m3fn` / `e5m2`)** checkpoints — the weights stay fp8 in memory and
  are cast to fp16 for the matmul. RDNA 2 has no fp8 hardware, so `--fast-fp8`
  has no effect and is ignored.
* Anything that still does not fit is offloaded to system RAM, which is what
  `--pin-shared-memory` accelerates.

## Flags that do nothing on AMD

These depend on CUDA-only libraries. Passing them prints a message and
continues, rather than failing the install:

`--xformers` · `--sage` · `--flash` · `--nunchaku` · `--onnxruntime-gpu` ·
`--cuda-malloc` · `--fast-fp8` (on RDNA 2)

---

## Troubleshooting

**"PyTorch (ROCm) cannot see your Radeon GPU"**
Update the Adrenalin driver, then delete `venv` and relaunch. If your card is
older than RDNA 2, try `--gpu-backend zluda`.

**"AMD does not publish Windows ROCm PyTorch wheels for your GPU architecture"**
Your card has no ROCm wheel family. Use `--gpu-backend zluda`.

**"ZLUDA needs the AMD HIP SDK, which was not found"**
Install HIP SDK 6.2 or 6.4, or set `HIP_PATH` to an existing install.

**"ZLUDA could not run a trivial matmul on your GPU"**
Usually a HIP SDK version mismatch (7.x is not supported), or a card whose
`rocBLAS` libraries are missing from the SDK.

**The warning about a mismatched PyTorch build**
Something replaced PyTorch — usually an extension's `install.py`, or a manual
`pip install -r requirements.txt`. Relaunch with `--reinstall-torch`.

**Out of memory during hires-fix**
Drop `--use-pytorch-cross-attention` if you added it, add `--reserve-vram 1.0`,
or switch to a GGUF/fp8 checkpoint.

## Reporting problems

`--dump-sysinfo` writes a report that includes the detected backend, GPU
architecture and PyTorch build. Attach it to any issue.
